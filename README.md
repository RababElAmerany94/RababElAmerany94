About me 👨🏻‍💻

Thank you for a look in. I'm a Full Stack developer and a technical blogger. Javascript, Typescript, ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Python, Django, Git, and GitHub 
are the technologies I use most often.

I write about Javascript, React, Python, and Django on platforms like hashnode, and I am also involved in dev communities.

I enjoy connecting with people to share ideas and knowledge.

My strength lies in a combination of self-learning and consistency. To improve myself at every moment, I believe in the learning process rather than results.

🌱 Currently, I am working in freelance.

Along with all of this, I am passionate about contributing to an open-source project. Currently, I am contributing to the OpenMetadata 
and react-awesome-shapes open-source community.
